  title: Things to [do]{.text-primary}
  description: If you decide to make a weekend of it, here are some things to do in the area.
  items:
    - title: Historic Downtown Mckinney
      description: A quaint, historic town with a lot of shops and restaurants.  It's a great place to walk around and enjoy the day.  For anyone here on Friday we'll meet at the Celt Irish Pub in downtown for happy hour and appetizers
      image: "/images/downtown.webp"
    - title: Dallas/Ft Worth
      description: Nature, History, Culture, Nightlife.  Ton's of places to find cool things to do in the area.  Downtown Dallas just a 40 minute drive and Ft. Worth a little over an hour way,  there are plenty of options for entertainment in the surrounding areas.

    - title: Dining and Entertainment
      description: Plenty of places to choose from with a simple google search.  From high-end dining and steakhouses to casual family friendly and chain restaurants.  But it's highly recommended to check out Hutchins BBQ for at some point, they always sell out so skip breakfast and get there early for top 5 BBQ in the US.
